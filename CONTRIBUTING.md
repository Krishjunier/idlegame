## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to uphold the [Code of Conduct](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-code-of-conduct). Please treat others with respect and be considerate of differing viewpoints.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug, have a feature request, or need clarification on something, please create an issue in the issue tracker. Be sure to include:

- A clear title and description
- An explanation of the issue
- Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable)
- The version of the project you're using

### Submitting Pull Requests (PRs)

When submitting a pull request, please ensure your code:

- Follows the project's coding standards (see [Coding Standards](#coding-standards))
- Passes all relevant tests
- Includes documentation if you're adding or modifying features

Hereâ€™s how to submit a pull request:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch from `main` for your feature or bugfix.
   - Use meaningful branch names like `feature/add-terminal-coloring` or `bugfix/fix-nano-command-hanging`.
3. Make your changes and commit them (see [Commit Guidelines](#commit-guidelines)).
4. Push your branch to your fork.
5. Submit a pull request (PR) to the `main` branch with a clear description of your changes.

## Commit Guidelines

Commits should follow these best practices:

- Make atomic, logical commits that each address one specific change.
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages. A good commit message is:
  - In present tense (e.g., "Fix bug in data validation")
  - Capitalized and concise

Avoid large or unrelated changes in a single commit or PR. If your changes span multiple areas of the codebase, break them up into separate commits or PRs.

## AI-Generated Commit Policy

In this project, we allow AI-assisted code generation but have specific guidelines for how AI-generated commits are handled. All commits will be reviewed to identify whether AI-generated content is involved.

There are two types of AI-generated commit tags:

- **`likely AI (severe)`**: This indicates that the commit is highly likely to have been generated by AI and contains significant portions of unoriginal, automated code. The `likely AI` tag is grounds for rejecting a contribution, but it can be disputed (see below). 
  
- **`maybe AI (warning)`**: This indicates that the commit might contain some AI-generated code, but it's not problematic. This is a cautionary tag. Commits tagged as `maybe AI` can still be accepted, but the author is encouraged to verify and defend their contribution in the PR comments as necessary.

In summary, using AI as a resource to help write your own **original code** is **fully accepted**. Directly using AI-written code may earn you a warning, but if you have **properly checked** it, it should be fine. Using AI generated code **without verifying it's effectiveness, looking over the code, or any other measures** will cause your contribution to be **rejected**.

### Disputing AI Tags

If you believe your commit has been unfairly tagged as AI-generated, you can dispute it by adding a comment on the PR. Be specific about which parts of the code are original and provide context where appropriate.

- If you can provide sufficient reasoning or context showing that the commit is valid and original, the tag may be downgraded or removed after review.
- Commits tagged as `likely AI (severe)` can only be reopened for review if substantial proof is given that the code is original.
- If you don't receive a response, please tag the account that marked your contribution as AI generated.

## Coding Standards

To keep the codebase clean and maintainable, all code should adhere to the following standards:

- Use consistent indentation and formatting; we use 4-width tab indentation and follow Prettier's standards.
- Follow best practices for the language you're working in (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).
- Write descriptive variable and function names to keep the code maintainable.
- Comment your code where appropriate, especially for complex logic.
- Include meaningful documentation where necessary (e.g., docstrings for functions).
- When writing new terminal commands for the game, it is recommended to duplicate a different one and change it.
  - You must have type hints, take player, args, and kwargs arguments, and a doctstring that will be displayed to the player through `man`

## Review Process

Once your PR is submitted, it will go through the following steps:

1. **Automated checks**: Your PR will be run through automated tests (if applicable) to ensure it passes all checks.
2. **Human review**: One or more maintainers will review your code for correctness, style, and adherence to the contribution guidelines.
3. **AI check**: If any commits are flagged as AI-generated, the appropriate tag will be applied (`likely AI (severe)` or `maybe ai (warning)`) and your PR may be closed.

After the review is complete, we will either merge your PR, provide feedback for changes, or close it if necessary.
